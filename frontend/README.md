# Rastasetu

## Project Overview

Rastasetu is a cross-platform mobile application that helps travelers connect, share their experiences, and earn rewards. It's built with modern technologies to provide a seamless experience across iOS and Android platforms, with web support.

### Key Features
- Share travel experiences and create engaging trip posts
- Connect with fellow travelers and build a community
- Earn rewards for your contributions and engagement
- Personalized user profiles and travel history
- Cross-platform support for iOS, Android, and Web

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Environment Setup**

Before you begin development, you'll need to set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` to your `.env` file
3. Update the values with your configuration:

```env
# API Configuration
API_URL=your_api_url
API_KEY=your_api_key

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_REWARDS=true
ENABLE_SOCIAL_LOGIN=true

# Storage
STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
```

> Note: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. The `.env.example` file serves as a template.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Recommended)**

1. **iOS**: Download the [Rork app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/rork) or [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
2. **Android**: Download the [Expo Go app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
3. Run `bun run start` and scan the QR code from your development server

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

You can test Rork apps in Expo Go or Rork iOS app. You don't need XCode or Android Studio for most features.

**When do you need Custom Development Builds?**

- Native authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Push notifications
- Custom native modules

If you have XCode (iOS) or Android Studio installed:

```bash
# iOS Simulator
bun run start -- --ios

# Android Emulator
bun run start -- --android
```

## Custom Development Builds

For advanced native features, you'll need to create a Custom Development Build instead of using Expo Go.

### **When do you need a Custom Development Build?**

- **Native Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In, Google Sign In
- **In-App Purchases**: App Store and Google Play subscriptions
- **Advanced Native Features**: Third-party SDKs, platform-specifc features (e.g. Widgets on iOS)
- **Background Processing**: Background tasks, location tracking

### **Creating a Custom Development Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```
